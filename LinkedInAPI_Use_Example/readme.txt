About Project:

This project is to get familiar with how to use public Api's provided by social media to extract user information into local system.

LinkedIn Developer key is first obtained and requested api data with the dev key. Tested in FF. Have accessed first level info in the JS file. Second level info can also be obtained from Api.

If the viewer is already logged into linkedin, authentication is not required. Else, user needs to sign in to linkedin inorder to get the personalised info page working. The system detects it and displays "Login To LinkedIn" button accordingly.

The Api returns all the data that is seen on screen, but only few are used, for demonstration purposes.
