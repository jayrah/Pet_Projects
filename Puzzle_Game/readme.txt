About Game:

This is a Memory Game , like Puzzles that you play with word cards. 

The Goal of the game is to match all colour cards with least number of trials.

You can open two cards at a time and if the colours are not same, it automatically gets closed within two seconds. You can then try seeing other two cards to see if they are of same colour.

For every mis-matched colour pair, your point is negated. If you remember matching cards and open them successively, your point increases by one. Yay! :).

A score-board with appreciative messages for every point scored, is provided to keep track of your moves.

The tricky part is, you CANNOT use mouse. But hey! if you do, there's not much remember-time for the mind!

The Technical Part:

The whole game is controlled within single Js file, written using jQuery.

The HTML is so minimalistic that it only provides the skeleton for the whole game.

CSS3 styling fills the gap and dynamic data and game navigation is controlled by the script.

Explicit comments added for every section in code to help walkthrough.

P.S: This is available in Mozilla for now. Working on cross-browser application
