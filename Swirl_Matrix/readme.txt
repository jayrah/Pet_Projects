About Project:

This is a single-page application that is a solution to 'Swirley Matrix' problem.

Swirl Matrix is a number matrix that builds itself in a spiral way outwards, incrementing numerical values along the way. The spiral is stopped when the matrix dimension is reached.

You can try the example by giving input as the matrix size and click on "Generate Matrix". The matrix is dynamically generated.

The direction is determined by the script and placing numbers in the specified direction (left or right) is done with the help of CSS positioning.
